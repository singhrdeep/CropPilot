## Project Overview

    CropPilot is a Python-based, open-source tool that helps small scale farmers, gardeners, hobbyists 
    plan, track, and analyze their crop operations.

    This tool is designed to be lightweight, extensible, and practical, providing users with clear 
    insights into profitability, sustainability, and resource management without needing 
    enterprise tools.

    This project started as a way to apply computer science to agriculture, which is one of the many
    fields I am interested in applying my major to. It is built to grow alongside my learning.
