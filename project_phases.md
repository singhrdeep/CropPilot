## Phase 1 - CLI (Completed)

**Goal: To build a working command-line interface that lets users input, view and save crop data.**

**Core Features:**
    - Add crop with name, cost, yield and price
    - Remove crop by number
    - Calculate profit (revenue - cost)
    - Save/load from 'crops.json'
    - Auto-save on exit
    - View all crops
    - CLI Menu

## Phase 2 - Data Integration (In Progress)

**Goal: Introduce static, realistic data to enrich crop records and enhance user experience.**

**Features:**
    - Use 2-month static average crop prices (editable)
    - Search/filter by crop name
    - Group crops by category
    - Summary dashboard (displays total profit, cost, revenue)
    - Currency toggle and conversion (USD to CAD and vice-versa using static rates)
    - Export to CSV

## Phase 3 - Visualization (Not Started)

**Goal: Make data insights and trends visual while retaining CLI.**

**Features:**
    - ASCII bar charts (for profit per crop)
